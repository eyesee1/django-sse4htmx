# Django SSE4HTMX

A simple wrapper around [Django EventStream's](https://github.com/fanout/django-eventstream) `send_event` to make it
simpler to send a properly formatted HTML fragment rendered from a template or a partial (if you
have [django-template-partials](https://github.com/carltongibson/django-template-partials/tree/main) installed). It
gives you a similar feel to Django's class-based views (CBVs).

## Installation

Install the package using `uv`:

```bash
uv add django-sse4htmx
```

Install the package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install django-sse4htmx
```

Install the package using `poetry`:

```bash
poetry add django-sse4htmx
```

## Usage

```python

from django_sse4htmx import ServerSentEventHTMLFragmentSender


class MyEventSender(ServerSentEventHTMLFragmentSender):
    channel_name = 'my_channel'
    template_name = 'my_template.html#my_partial'

    def get_context_data(self):
        return {
            'my_context': 'my_context_value',
            'request': self.kwargs.get('request'),
        }


# in your code anywhere such as a view, a signal responder,
# a queued task in a task queue, etc.:

MyEventSender()(value="some value")
```

Any keyword arguments passed to the `__call__` method will be passed to the template or partial as context variables.

## Gotchas

- The current request and other values that are normally in the template context will not be there unless you pass them
  explicitly as keyword arguments to the `__call__` method (as shown in the example above). The current
  request is only available from a view or a middleware, so you may need to adjust your templates (or partials)
  accordingly if your template code assumes their presence.

## Code of Conduct

- If contributing or participating in this project in any way, including posting issues or feature requests, you are
  expected to abide by
  the [Python Software Foundation's Code of Conduct](https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/).

## Roadmap

1. âœ… Initial release, works in quick manual testing with the sample project.
2. Add Unit Tests
3. Support for i18n/l10n given a language code.
4. Consider adding a way to send multiple events at once (if users even want it, which could happen since HTMX supports
   it)
